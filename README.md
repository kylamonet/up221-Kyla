## About Me  
My name is Kyla Foreman and I am a second year MURP in the Community Economic Development and Housing (CEDH) concentration. I am from Sacramento and will forever be that girl rooting for the Kings. I love to prioritze self-care, play fun word or number puzzles (Sudoku is my current favorite), and explore neighborhoods in Los Angeles through food, art, music, and human connections.
