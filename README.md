## About Me  
My name is Kyla Foreman and I am a second year MURP in the Community Economic Development and Housing (CEDH) concentration. I call Sacramento, California my home. I love to prioritize self-care, play fun word or number puzzles (Sudoku is my current favorite), and explore neighborhoods in Los Angeles through food, art, music, and human connections.
